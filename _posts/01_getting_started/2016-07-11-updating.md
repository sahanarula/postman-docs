### Native Apps

#### MacOS & Windows
Postman's native apps on MacOS & Windows will notify you whenever an update is available. To force a check, head over to the Update section of the Settings window. If an update is available, you can choose to start the download. Postman will notify you when then download is complete, and you'll need to restart the app to apply the update.

#### Linux
Postman's native apps on Linux will notify you whenever an update is available. To force a check, head over to the Update section of the Settings window. If an update is available, you need to download the latest version of the application from [https://www.getpostman.com/apps][2] and replace the current application directory with the new version. Postman stores all user data outside of the application directory, so you can safely replace the current application directory with the new version.

### Chrome App

Postman's Chrome app is usually updated automatically. However, we have little visibility into the actual update flow, and Chrome sometimes doesn't update the app for a long time.

The latest version is visible on Postman's webstore listing - [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop?hl=en][0].

To manually force an update, here's what you need to do:

1. Head to [chrome://extensions][1] in Chrome
2. Enable 'Developer Mode'
3. Click the 'Update extensions now' button
